# Final Project  
## Redesign: South Loop Chamber of Commerce   

You’ll undertake a complete redesign of the South Loop Chamber of Commerce website and produce a pamphlet they can hand out to prospective members along with a working web form that allows for new member applications. Your website and member materials should include a graphic/graphics that explain how the organization raises money and what they spend it on.     You’ll draw all your copy and images from the South Loop Chamber website:  http://www.southloopchamberofcommerce.com​.

We’ll form teams of four, and it will be up to you to  plan and distribute work in order to meet the deadline. You’ll present your project during the final  exam period of the course: Tuesday, December 4th, 2:00 p.m. 

## Procedure and Recommendations 

This project has two main components: the website with the working application form and the recruitment pamphlet with financial information.   
You don’t need to replicate the information structure of the existing website; in fact, you should completely avoid using the current design. Your website will have to have the following information (you can find it all on the website):  
- ★ Officers and board members 
- ★ A list of all city services 
- ★ A list of current members 
- ★ Membership FAQs and financials graphic(s) 
- ★ A working submission form to file a membership application that includes all the fields in the current application (I strongly recommend using Google Forms for the backend collection.) 
- ★ A news/events page that has the following events: Small Business Saturday and the cocktail  party fundraiser (Note: you don’t have to update your project with new events if the  organization posts them after 11/12.) 
- ★ Links to social media
